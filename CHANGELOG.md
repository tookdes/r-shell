## [Unreleased]


## [1.5.0] - 2026-04-30

### 🔁 R-Shell 1.5 — Reliable Reconnect

This release fixes reconnect flows that previously left the terminal permanently stuck after a network drop.

### Fixed

- 🔌 **SSH Reconnect Re-establishes Session**: Reconnect actions (tab bar button and right-click menu) now properly re-authenticate to the backend before restarting the PTY, instead of reusing the dead SSH connection
  - `handleReconnect` in `App.tsx` dispatches `RECONNECT_TAB` after a successful SSH reconnect to remount the terminal on the fresh connection
  - Tab bar Reconnect calls the full backend reconnect path (`onReconnectTab`) instead of a bare state dispatch
  - Right-click Reconnect in the PTY terminal delegates to `onReconnectTab` from context, with a WebSocket-only fallback when run outside a provider


## [1.4.0] - 2026-04-24

### 🖥️ R-Shell 1.4 — OS Detection & Distro-Aware System Monitoring

This release adds intelligent OS detection and cross-distro system monitoring, so CPU, memory, disk, and uptime metrics work correctly across different Linux distributions — not just the common case.

### Added

- 🔍 **OS Detection Module** (`os_detect`): Detects remote OS type and distribution info (distro, version, package manager) on connect
  - Caches `OsInfo` per connection in `ConnectionManager` to avoid repeated system calls
  - Supports accurate metric collection across different Linux distributions

- 🛡️ **Error Boundary Component**: New React `ErrorBoundary` wraps key UI sections to catch and display render errors gracefully instead of crashing the whole app

### Changed

- 🖥️ **Distro-Aware System Monitor**: `get_system_stats` now uses OS-specific commands for CPU, memory, disk, and uptime stats
  - Selects the correct command variant based on detected distro (e.g. handles differences between Debian, Alpine, Arch, etc.)
  - `system-monitor` component updated to pass OS context to backend commands

- ♻️ **WebSocket Server Refactored**: Improved flow control and connection lifecycle handling
- 🧹 **Code Cleanup**: Improved formatting and import organization across `commands.rs`, `ftp_client.rs`, `sftp_client.rs`, `ssh/mod.rs`, and `lib.rs`


## [1.3.1] - 2026-04-01

### Fixed

- 🔐 **RSA SSH Server Compatibility**: Resolved "No common key algorithm" connection failure for RSA-keyed SSH servers
  - Added support for `ssh-rsa` host key algorithm for compatibility with older servers
  - Fixes connection issues with legacy SSH servers that only support RSA host keys

### Changed
